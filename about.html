  <p>
    <strong>Hi!</strong> I’m Martin Bean, an experienced software engineer and web developer based in the <abbr class="initialism" title="United Kingdom">UK.</abbr>
    I currently lead of a team of developers at a product company called <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://openplay.net" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">OpenPlay</a>.
    Prior to this, I worked at <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://pfizer.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Pfizer</a>, first as part of their <abbr title="Developer Operations">DevOps</abbr> team before moving into a tech lead role, where I directed two company-wide transformation and consolidation projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of my full time role I run <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://www.yourfightsite.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Your Fight Site</a>.
    Under its banner I operate two services targeting professional wrestling and combat sport promoters: a website builder called Your Fight Site <abbr class="initialism" title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, and a video on demand marketplace called <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://vod.yourfightsite.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Your Fight Site VOD</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    In my spare time I dabble in reverse engineering video games, specifically PlayStation&reg; 1.
    This has been a hugely interesting endeavour for me, going from knowing little about computer architecture and hardware to learning concepts like <abbr class="initialism" title="Central Processing Units">CPUs</abbr> and registers, as well as assembly and the C programming language, and also just how video games were actually made in that time period.
  </p>
  <p>
    I’m a lifelong learner with a thirst for knowledge, and enjoy sharing this knowledge.
    I’m active in communities such as <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://stackoverflow.com/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and the <a class="font-weight-semibold" href="https://laracasts.com/discuss" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Laracasts forums</a>, and I now share this knowledge in my current role as a team lead.
