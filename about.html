  <p><strong>Hi!</strong> I’m Martin Bean, a software engineer and full-stack web developer based in Newcastle upon Tyne, <abbr class="initialism" title="United Kingdom">UK</abbr>. I enjoy creating elegant solutions to complex problems.</p>
  <p>I have over a decade of experience, including nearly five years running my own freelance consultancy. I currently work for an e-commerce company called <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://www.visualsoft.co.uk/" rel="external noopener" target="_blank">Visualsoft</a> as a senior developer in their <abbr title="Research &amp; Development">R&amp;D</abbr> department where I’m refactoring the company’s legacy, monolith platform into <abbr class="initialism" title="Representational State Transfer">REST</abbr>ful <abbr class="initialism" title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s.</p>
  <p>In my spare time, I run a business called <a class="font-weight-bold" href="https://www.yourfightsite.com/" rel="external" target="_blank">Your Fight Site</a>.
    As a teenager, I began building websites for independent professional wrestling promotions.
    I now build <abbr title="Software-as-a-Service">SaaS</abbr> products for the professional wrestling, <abbr class="initialism" title="Mixed Martial Arts">MMA</abbr>, and boxing industries.
    Products include a self-service <abbr class="initialism" title="Video On Demand">VOD</abbr> platform and a multi-tenant <abbr class="initialism" title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>.</p>
  <p>Day-to-day I work with technologies such as PHP, MySQL, Postgres, and Amazon Web Services.
    I also have lots of experience working with semantic, accessible, and <abbr class="initialism" title="Search Engine Optimisation">SEO</abbr>-friendly <abbr class="initialism" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>; <abbr class="initialism" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> (both with and without preprocessors); and JavaScript (including modern <abbr class="initialism" title="ECMAScript">ES</abbr> syntax, frameworks like Vue and React, and build tools such as Webpack).
    Other technology interests include Go and Swift. I’m also dabbling with BrightScript for Roku channel development.</p>
  <p>My work so far has spanned multiple companies and industries, meaning I’ve worked with codebases of all shapes and sizes.
    I’m available for limited consultancy engagements.
    I can offer advice and insights on projects, perform code reviews and audits of existing codebases, and development of smaller projects.
    If you think there’s something I may be able to help you with, then feel free to <a class="font-weight-bold" href="{% link contact.html %}">contact me</a> and we can look to arrange something.</p>
