Accountancy software giant [FreeAgent][1] got in touch with me in the back end
of 2015 asking me to contribute to a book for freelancers who want to better
manage their money.

The book contains chapters written by a mix of freelancers, supported with tips
and advice contributed from other freelancers including myself throughout the
book.
