          <h1>Testimonials</h1>
          <p>Being freelance means I&rsquo;ve been lucky to work with many awesome people and companies.
            Below are some things that people I&rsquo;ve worked with have said.</p>

        <article class="testimonial">
          <blockquote>
            <p>I worked with Martin for six months on a project initially involving the refactoring of a large legacy codebase and subsequently the development of new features.</p>
            <p>Martin quickly integrated with the team, and adapted to our development setup. He was able to quickly adapt to new tools, technologies and frameworks and worked at a rapid pace in refactoring the code, and developing new features. On particular strength is Martin&rsquo;s ability to track down and fix issues in code&mdash;reporting issues on GitHub, discussing things with open source project maintainers and trying a range of approaches to find solutions to problems in third party code.</p>
            <p>I enjoyed working with Martin and hope to get the chance to work with him on another project in the future.</p>

          <blockquote>
            <p>I have worked with Martin on a number of projects for the ScS website and associated online collateral. At each step of the way, I have found him to be extremely knowledgeable in his field and precise at delivering to our brief. I would certainly work with him again and I would recommend him to any others looking for an expert in web development.</p>
