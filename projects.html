                <p>BAMMA is Europe&rsquo;s premier mixed martial arts promotion, with live events broadcasts on Channel 5 and sister channel 5&#10026; in the UK. BAMMA promotes the cream of upcoming British talent alongside international stars.</p>
                <p>In mid-2013, BAMMA came to me looking to revamp their web presence. I built a bespoke website framework and content management system with CakePHP, and heavily customised Zurb Foundation for the front-end design.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft Reflections got in touch with me in the summer of 2013, looking for someone to develop their HTML5 and JavaScript framework for the Xbox SmartGlass version of <i>Just Dance</i>&reg; 2014.</p>
                <p>Working with gameplay programmers, I transformed Reflection&rsquo;s prototype into an event-driven framework communicating with the Xbox 360 and Xbox One console versions of the title.</p>

                <p>During my time at ScS I built the &ldquo;Sleep Centre&rdquo; section of the website and integrated it with their bespoke shopping cart.
                  I also developed various tools as part of this process, including mass import tools for various manufacturers&rsquo; <abbr class="initialism" title="Comma-Separated Value">CSV</abbr> files.</p>
                <p>I also integrated new templates into the website and took the time to start re-factoring the front-end <abbr class="initialism" title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr>, <abbr class="initialism" title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> and JavaScript, and crating a style guide.</p>
                <p>Whilst at ScS, I also introduced industry-standard practices such as version control with Git, and automated code deployment in place of <abbr class="initialism" title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr>.</p>

                <p>Lostbox is a new lost and found website that uses the power of social media to extend their reach and get people reunited with their missing items as quickly as possible.</p>
                <p>I was commissioned to design and develop the website. The front-end was built with Twitter Bootstrap based on the logo provided by the client, and the website was built using the CakePHP framework and includes a custom-built administration area to manage users, items, categories and adverts.</p>

                <p>Working as part of a team of three, we re-factored the entire Bdaily website, making use of Symfony components and Amazon Web Services along the way. With a solid foundation in place, we then began developing new features for the website.</p>
                <p>One of my main tasks during my time working on the Bdaily website was the creation of a new advertisements system that allowed members to specify and purchase advert placements on the site. Purchases were then handled by the GoCardless payment gateway.</p>
