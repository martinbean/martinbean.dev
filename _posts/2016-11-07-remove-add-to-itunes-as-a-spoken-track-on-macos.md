If you’re a web developer and use macOS then I’m sure you’ve done it: hit “Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track” from the context menu instead of “Inspect” in Google Chrome.

Luckily, this menu item can be removed.
And it’s not in the place you would expect it to be.

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Choose **Keyboard**.
3. Select the **Shortcuts** tab.
4. Choose **Services** from the left-hand pane.
5. Within the **Text** group you will see **Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track**. Un-check.

And that’s it!
No more accidentally adding highlighted text as a spoken track to iTunes!
