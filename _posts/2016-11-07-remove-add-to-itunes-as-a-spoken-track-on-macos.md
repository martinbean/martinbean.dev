<p class="lead">If you’re a web developer and use macOS then I’m sure you’ve done it: hit “Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track” from the context menu instead of “Inspect” in Google Chrome.</p>

Luckily, this menu item can be removed.
And it’s not in the place you would expect it to be.

1. Open **System Preferences**.
2. Choose **Keyboard**.
3. Select the **Shortcuts** tab.
4. Choose **Services** from the left-hand pane.
5. Within the **Text** group you will see **Add to iTunes as a Spoken Track**. Un-check.

And that’s it!
No more accidentally adding highlighted text as a spoken track to iTunes!
