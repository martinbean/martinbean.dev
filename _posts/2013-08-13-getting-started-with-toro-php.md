title: Getting Started with Toro PHP
---
For a while now I’ve been a contributor to [ToroPHP][1], a small PHP router suited for developing <abbr title="Representational state transfer">REST</abbr>ful web applications and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s.

Earlier this year, [Web & PHP Magazine][2] asked me to write an article on getting started with Toro PHP which was published in their August issue.

You can read the article at [http://webandphp.com/GettingStartedwithToroPHP-166084][3], or why not download the entire of [August’s issue][4] with articles on Git, realtime PHP apps, and much more.
