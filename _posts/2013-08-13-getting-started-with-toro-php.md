title: Getting Started with Toro PHP

<p class="lead">For a while now I’ve been a contributor to <a href="http://toroweb.org/" rel="external">ToroPHP</a>, a small PHP router suited for developing <abbr title="Representational state transfer">REST</abbr>ful web applications and <abbr title="Application Programming Interface">API</abbr>s.</p>

Earlier this year, [Web & PHP Magazine](http://webandphp.com/) asked me to write an article on getting started with Toro PHP which was published in their August issue.

You can read the article at [http://webandphp.com/GettingStartedwithToroPHP-166084](http://webandphp.com/GettingStartedwithToroPHP-166084), or why not download the entire of [August’s issue](http://webandphp.com/system/files/wpm_2013_08.pdf) with articles on Git, realtime PHP apps, and much more.
