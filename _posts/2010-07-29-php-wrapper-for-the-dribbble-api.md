title: PHP Wrapper for the Dribbble API
---
For those familiar with Dribbble, I’ve written a small wrapper class for those wanting to interact with their newly-released API on their own PHP-powered websites.

The source code for the class can be found on my GitHub acccount, at [github.com/martinbean/dribbble-php][1]

Credit goes to Jeremy Weiskotten, whose Ruby on Rails solution inspired me to write a PHP version!

**Update:** some nice chaps who run a blog called _Build Internet_ have written a tutorial using my PHP wrapper for the Dribbble API.
