Recently on Twitter, I announced that Iâ€™d be creating my first premium video course covering how to build a subscription-based video streaming website with [Laravel][1], [Mux][2], and [Stripe][3]:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">ðŸ“¢ Ever wanted to build your own <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@netflix</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/laracasts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@laracasts</a>? Iâ€™ll soon be recording a premium video course on creating a video streaming website with <a href="https://twitter.com/laravelphp?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@laravelphp</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/MuxHQ?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@muxhq</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stripe?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stripe</a>. Join my newsletter to hear when, and for an exclusive early access discount!<a href="https://t.co/hltsjyWDsS">https://t.co/hltsjyWDsS</a></p>&mdash; Martin Bean (@martinbean) <a href="https://twitter.com/martinbean/status/1490707910963433474?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2022</a></blockquote>

Iâ€™ve started a [newsletter][4] where Iâ€™ll be sending updates and announcements for this course, as well as of course exclusive subscriber-only discounts and early access to the course.

If you missed the first issue of the newsletter, then in it I announced what weâ€™ll be covering, as well as the reasons Iâ€™ve decided to make this course, and when it will be ready.

The course will touch on both front- and back-end development, using [Laravel][1], [Vue.js][5], [Mux][2], and [Stripe][3]. So, without further ado, here is the outline!

## What the course will cover
* Installing and setting up Laravel 9
* Building a multi-part video uploader with Vue.js
* Creating assets in Mux for videos
* Subscribing to Mux webhooks to know when video assets are ready
* Creating an admin panel to edit video details and to publish videos
* Creating Stripe subscriptions with Laravel Cashier

And much more in between.

So if youâ€™ve ever wanted to build your own [Netflix][6] or even [Laracasts][7], this is the course for you! Iâ€™ll be sending the second issue in the next couple of days, so if youâ€™re interested in learning more then you can sign up here: https://www.getrevue.co/profile/martinbean
