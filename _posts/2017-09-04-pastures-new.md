It’s with great pleasure to say that on 1 September 2017, I officially joined
[Pitchero][1] as a software developer on a full time basis.

It comes after contracting for the company since May. Being based in Newcastle
upon Tyne, I’m really grateful that Pitchero have been accommodating and letting
me split my time between working from home in Newcastle and working out of their
office near Leeds.

I’ll be working on Pitchero‘s core product—a platform for creating websites for
grassroots sports club—adding new features and re-factoring their legacy codebase
to use the Laravel PHP framework.

It’s been a roundabout journey! I’d been in touch with Pitchero team for about
5–6 years prior, and meeting Jon, the <abbr class="initialism" title="Chief Technical Officer">CTO</abbr>,
at conferences such as [PHP North West][2]. But it was only this year we got an
opportunity to work together.

It’s been a pleasure working with the Pitchero team the past few months, and I’m
pleased I’ll be continuing to do so going forward as a full time team member.
